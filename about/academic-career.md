My group specializes in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), i.e. the infrastructure surrounding blockchains. My focus was on formal verification and vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Particularly, my research was developing and adapting tools for the Move smart contract language.

All the names associated with my degree are a bit confusing, so I would like to quickly explain them. First, what is **Engineering Science** (EngSci)? At the University of Toronto, there are two types of engineering programs: Core 8 and EngSci. In summary, EngSci is the honors engineering program. It's harder to be accepted, the courses tend to move at a faster pace covering more material, the exams are harder, and you are required to do both a capstone and a thesis at the end (Core 8's get to choose one). You can find more information <a href="https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/engineering-programs/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Second, what does **Machine Intelligence** mean? Since EngSci is the honors engineering program, it contains highly specialized majors. I think the name "Machine Intelligence" was a bad one. In essence, it's classic computer engineering with an emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence.
