## Executive Summary

I am a Masters of Applied Science graduate in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto pursuing a career in the field of AI/ML. 

My education consists of a **Master of Applied Science** degree from the University of Toronto in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research focus was formal verification and security vulnerabilities of smart contract language on blockchains. Before that, I completed a **Bachelor of Applied Science** at the University of Toronto in Engineering Science, with a specialty in Machine Learning. My undergraduate thesis topic was Natural Language Processing, analyzing different methods of prompt selection to improve performance using few-shot learning.

My job experience consists mostly of software development. I have three summers worth of experience in full-stack development at AI start-ups as well as experience in back-end web development including an internship with Salesforce. Going forward, I am branching out of software development to best utilize my other skills. I am personable, have a passion for breaking down complexity in a way anyone can understand, am a good public speaker (supported by more than 2 years of teaching experience), and have a breadth of knowledge in many areas.

My free time consists of a variety of activities. I am an avid golfer in the summer and play men's league hockey in the winter. I love playing strategic games such as chess and poker. I love solving puzzles such as sudokus and Rubik's cubes. Anything involving learning a new skill I could potentially be interested in.

## How to Pronounce My Name

Most people mispronounce my last name. It seems to be that pesky "i" that messes everyone up. Below I've given the phonetic pronunciation and the IPA representation of my name, which you could copy-paste into an <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/" target="_blank">IPA reader</a>.

<center>
    Eric Keilty &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (air-ik kel-tee) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; /&epsilon;rIk k&epsilon;lti/
</center>
<br>
To remember the correct pronunciation, recall that &nbsp; _i_ &nbsp; in math is imaginary. It is also imaginary in my last name. So we can pretend my name is "Eric Kelty", and your natural pronunciation is probably correct.
