I imagine different people would come here for different reasons.

You might want to know my [work experience](/about/professional-career).

Or learn about my [academic background](/about/academic-career).

Or see some of my past [awards and achievements](/about/awards-and-achievements).

Or you might just want to just get to [know me](/about/personal-interests) as a person.

## Executive Summary

I am a recent MASc graduate currently looking for work. 

My education consists of a **Master of Applied Science** degree from the University of Toronto in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research focus was formal verification and security vulnerabilities of smart contract language on blockchains. Before that, I completed a **Bachelor of Applied Science** at the University of Toronto in Engineering Science, with a specialty in Machine Learning. My undergraduate thesis topic was Natural Language Processing, analyzing different methods of prompt selection to improve performance using few-shot learning.

My job experience consists mostly of software development. I have six summers worth of experience in front-end, back-end, and full-stack development working mainly for start-ups and an internship with Salesforce. Going forward, I am branching out of software development to best utilize my other skills. I am personable, have a passion for breaking down complexity in a way anyone can understand, am a good public speaker, and have a breadth of knowledge in many areas. I think consulting and product management are jobs that I can excel in, although I am open to considering any potential opportunity.

My free time consists of a variety of activites. I am an avid golfer in the summer and play men's league hockey in the winter. I love playing strategic games such as chess and poker. I love solving puzzles such as sudokus and Rubik's cubes. Anything involving learning a new skill I could potentially be interested in.

## How to Pronounce My Name

Most people mispronounce my last name. It seems to be that pesky "i" that messes everyone up. Below I've given the phonetic pronunciation and the IPA representation of my name, which you could copy-paste into an <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/" target="_blank">IPA reader</a>.

<center>
    Eric Keilty &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (air-ik kel-tee) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; /&epsilon;rIk k&epsilon;lti/
</center>
<br>
To remember the correct pronunciation, recall that &nbsp; _i_ &nbsp; in math is imaginary. It is also imaginary in my last name. So we can pretend my name is "Eric Kelty", and your natural pronunciation is probably correct.

## Too Long; Didn't Read

Here, I'll give an executive summary of my academic background, my professional background, and my personality. 

I completed a Bachelor of Applied Science degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I studied [Engineer Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) with a specialty in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/). These programs are very badly named and require a bit of explanation (see hyperlinks), but the short version is that I was in the honors engineering program and specialized in something similar to computer engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently, I am completing a Master of Applied Science degree at the University of Toronto in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department. My research focuses on the formal verification of smart contracts (I know, a bit of a left turn from AI). You can find my full academic history and my achievements/awards here.

I worked a few interesting odd jobs including being a poker dealer at a Casino, but here I will only include the most relevant ones. You can find my full list of all my past employment here. 

My background seems to suggest that I am a Software Engineer, but I don't want
