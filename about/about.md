I imagine different people would come here for different reasons.

You might want to know my [work experience](/about/professional-career).

Or learn about my [academic background](/about/academic-career).

Or see some of my past [awards and achievements](/about/awards-and-achievements).

Or you might just want to just get to [know me](/about/personal-interests) as a person.

## Executive Summary

**TODO**

I've always had a love for learning, an addictive personality, and a deeply competitive nature. This combination is what I believe is the reason for the success I've found in my life. 

I have completed an undergraduate Bachelor of Applied Science degree at the University of Toronto in Engineering Science specializing in Machine Intelligence (AI/ML). My undergraduate thesis focused on Natural Language Processing, studying how best to preprompt GPT2 to maximize its performance. I have also completed a Master of Applied Science degree also at the University of Toronto in Electrical and Computer Engineering specializing in formal verification of smart contract languages on blockchains. My thesis focused on the Move language, developing formal verification and vulnerability detection tools.

## How to Pronounce My Name

Most people mispronounce my last name. It seems to be that pesky "i" that messes everyone up. Below I've given the phonetic pronunciation and the IPA representation of my name, which you could copy-paste into an <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/" target="_blank">IPA reader</a>.

<center>
    Eric Keilty &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (air-ik kel-tee) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; /&epsilon;rIk k&epsilon;lti/
</center>
<br>
To remember the correct pronunciation, recall that &nbsp; _i_ &nbsp; in math is imaginary. It is also imaginary in my last name. So we can pretend my name is "Eric Kelty", and your natural pronunciation is  probably correct.

## Too Long; Didn't Read

Here, I'll give an executive summary of my academic background, my professional background, and my personality. 

I completed a Bachelor of Applied Science degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I studied [Engineer Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) with a specialty in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/). These programs are very badly named and require a bit of explanation (see hyperlinks), but the short version is that I was in the honors engineering program and specialized in something similar to computer engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently, I am completing a Master of Applied Science degree at the University of Toronto in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department. My research focuses on the formal verification of smart contracts (I know, a bit of a left turn from AI). You can find my full academic history and my achievements/awards here.

I worked a few interesting odd jobs including being a poker dealer at a Casino, but here I will only include the most relevant ones. You can find my full list of all my past employment here. 

My background seems to suggest that I am a Software Engineer, but I don't want
