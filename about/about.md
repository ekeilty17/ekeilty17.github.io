I imagine different people would come here for different reasons.

You might want to know my [academic background](/about/academic-career).

You might want to learn about my past [work experience](/about/professional-career).

Or you might just want to get to [know me](/about/personal-interests) as a person.


## Too Long; Didn't Read

Here, I'll give an executive summary of my academic background, my professional background, and my personality. 

I completed a Bachelor of Applied Science degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I studied [Engineer Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) with a specialty in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/). These programs are very badly named and require a bit of explanation (see hyperlinks), but the short version is that I was in the honors engineering program and specialized in something similar to computer engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently, I am completing a Master of Applied Science degree at the University of Toronto in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department. My research focuses on the formal verification of smart contracts (I know, a bit of a left turn from AI). You can find my full academic history and my achievements/awards here.

I worked a few interesting odd jobs including being a poker dealer at a Casino, but here I will only include the most relevant ones. You can find my full list of all my past employment here.

<center>
    Eric Keilty &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (air-ik kel-tee) &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; /&epsilon;rIk k&epsilon;lti/
</center>
<br>
To remember the correct pronunciation, recall that _i_ in math is imaginary. It is also imaginary in my last name. So we can pretend my name is "Eric Kelty".

In a way, these links are more for my benefit than anyone else, so that I can remember all the things I've done. But in case you are curious
