## Relations and Hypernumbers

**TODO** possibly make this its own post

Suppose $\b{x}, \b{y} \in {^* \mathbb{X}}$ such that $\b{x} = [\iseq{x_n}{n}]$ and $\b{y} = [\iseq{y_n}{n}]$ are hypernumbers and $\sim$ is any relation well-defined in $\mathbb{X}$. Then, we can extend $\sim$ to the hyperset ${^* \mathbb{X}}$ via element-wise evaluation and the intuitive concept of "differ in only finitely many places"

Technically, we should be writing ${^*{=}}$ or something like this. For example

$$
\b{x} \ {^* {=}} \ \b{y}
$$

However, I think this will really star

**TODO** Can talk about a baby transfer-principle where a formula in the form of a predicate is always transferable between numbers and hypernumbers. For example, the triangle inequality
