Everyone has inner demons. In the current culture (at least in the West) there has been a large emphasis on mental health. As a result, these issues are being acknlowedged and doctors are trying their best help. Unfortunately, I think we are currently very naive and short-sighted in our approach.

I am not a doctor. I am not a mental health researcher. In this essay I am not trying to offer medical advice. What I am trying to offer is a philosophy. A perspective on mental health that I feel has been forgotten.

## Eternal Bliss

I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of what is means to be "curred" of a mental health issue. Many people image it means these issues will never come back. Unfortunately, this is not how it works. Whatever issues you have will be issues forever. We see this in drug/gambling addicts. We see this in victums of tramatic events. And we see this when we lose people close to us. We learn to accept our reality rather than erease it.

Further than this, I'm not sure what it would mean to remove my mental health problems from myself. I image a version of myself in the stereotypical portrayal of heaven, where anxiety, depression, anger, lust, etc are impossible. Would I even be the same person? What does it mean to always be happy? I'm not sure.

## Numbing the Pain

While suffering from mental health issues, all you want is for it all to stop. 

In my experience, those who struggle from mental health issues often cope by distracting themselves. This distraction can come in many forms. 

Our goal is often to completely rid the symptoms of the mental health problem
