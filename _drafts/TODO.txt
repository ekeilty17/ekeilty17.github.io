Webiste Improvements
- I need to figure out the best way to write up posts. I don't think I want to use the built-in latex in Jekyll because it doesn't have all the features and it's not easy to export elsewhere. One possibliity is to write them as a latex PDF and just upload the PDF, but those might not look as good on the webpage. Experimentation is needed.
- Simplify the layout on the homepage. Something more playful like "see my projects", "read some stuff", etc.
- need to upload mt resume, although again that's a bit tricky because I've done a bunch of random things.
