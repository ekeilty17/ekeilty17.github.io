Website Improvements
    - Write my about page
    - need to upload my resume, although again that's a bit tricky because I've done a bunch of random things.
    - reformat the blog archive page and make it look nicer

Blog Ideas
    Series
        - All continuity proofs using delta-epsilon
        - All standard derivatives
        - All standard integrals
        - Write up my algorithms course notes
        - Solid of revolutions
        - arc lengths, could throw in the calculus of variations
        - optimization? Linear/convex/nonconvex? Not sure what I'd include
        - probability theory? again, not sure what I'd include
        - center of mass / rotational inertia intergals. These really fun

    Stand-Alone
        - Tau vs Pi, compare formulas and see if there's actually a difference
        - Rubik's cube commutators and creating your own algorithms (although that will require a lot of animation)
        - Rubik's cube patterns...and the small number of interesting ones
        - The physics of Newton's cradle (with better diagrams than currently exist)
        - I want to do some stuff with country data...
        - I also want to do some stuff with NHL data...
        - GOAT/BOAT debate in hockey 
        - Polynomials, if the discriminant is negative, then it has no real solutions. When does it have only imaginary solutions? What does that look like graphically?
        - Explaining the BlackJack basic strategy table, the actual math and maybe some rules of thumb
