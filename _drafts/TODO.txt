Website Improvements
- Write my about page
- I would really like to be able to write tikz code in markdown files. 
  This seems promising, https://gist.github.com/AlexBobkov/d419863e610fce7c8db5714b665b009e, but I haven't gotten it to work
- need to upload my resume, although again that's a bit tricky because I've done a bunch of random things.
- reformat the blog archive page and make it look nicer

Blog Ideas
- All continuity proofs using delta-epsilon
- All standard derivatives
- All standard integrals
- Write up my algorithms course notes
