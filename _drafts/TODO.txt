Website Improvements
- Write my about page
- need to upload my resume, although again that's a bit tricky because I've done a bunch of random things.
- reformat the blog archive page and make it look nicer

Blog Ideas
- All continuity proofs using delta-epsilon
- All standard derivatives
- All standard integrals
- Write up my algorithms course notes
- Tau vs Pi, compare formulas and see if there's actually a difference
- Solid of revolutions
- arc lengths, could throw in the calculus of variations
- optimization? Linear/convex/nonconvex? Not sure what I'd include
- probability theory? again, not sure what I'd include
- center of mass / rotational inertia intergals. These really fun
