Starting off with some really simple identities, these all follow straight from the definitions and require almost no proof.

## Reciprocal Identities

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{1}{r/y} = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}
$$

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{1}{r/x} = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}
$$

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{1}{x/y} = \frac{1}{\cot \theta}
$$

## Ratio Identities

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y/r}{x/r} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1/\csc \theta}{1/\sec \theta} = \frac{\sec \theta}{\csc \theta}
$$

$$
\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x/r}{y/r} = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{1/\sec \theta}{1/\csc \theta} = \frac{\csc \theta}{\sec \theta}
$$

Now, once the value of $\sin(\theta)$ and $\cos(\theta)$ are defined, the values of the rest of the functions are forced. In fact, eventually, we'll see how the value of $\cos (\theta)$ can be derived from $\sin (\theta)$. Thus, in a way, all of these functions are really just syntactic sugar for a singular deeper truth, which is the geometry of the unit circle.
