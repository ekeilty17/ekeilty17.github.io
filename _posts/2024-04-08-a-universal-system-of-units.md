Everyone holds the metric system up as the gold standard for a system of measurements. While I agree it's great, it's definitely a human-centered system of measurements. The meter is ultimately derived from the median of the Earth. And the fact everything operates on increments of $10$ is just because we use a base-$10$ number system, which ultimately is due to humans having $10$ fingers. 

In this post, I want to derive a **universal system of units**. I this to be independent of humans, and possible for, say, an alien civilization to derive.

## High-Level Process

For every type of measurement, we are going to find the smallest possible unit that has any significance in quantum mechanics. This is called the **Planck unit**. From there, we will derive all the remaining units.

The metric system does this by multiplying by a factor of $10$ to get the next unit. This makes sense for humans since a vast majority of our number systems are base-$10$. However, from a universalist perspective, $10$ is an arbitrary choice. To me, the only choice that is not arbitrary is to choose a factor of $2$. 

Therefore, we will start at the Planck unit and iteratively multiply by $2$ in order to get larger and larger units.

If we take the standard meters for example, we have the prefixed $\mu m$, $mm$, $m$, $km$, and $Mm$. These each translate to $m \times 10^{-6}$, $m \times 10^{-3}$, $m \times 10^{0}$, $m \times 10^{3}$, and $m \times 10^{6}$.

I will steal the notation from computer science. We instead of the prefixes $\mu i m$, $mim$, $m$, $kim$, and $Mim$. These each translate to $m \times 2^{-6}$, $m \times 2^{-3}$, $m \times 2^{0}$, $m \times 2^{3}$, and $m \times 2^{6}$.

## Distance

We define our base unit, the **Planck length**

$1 \, \ell_{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\hslash G}{c^3}} = 1.616255 \times 10^{âˆ’35} \, m $

Now, we get an upper bound.

$$
\text{Length of observable universe} = 96 \times 10^9 \, \text{light-years} = 8.8 \times 10^{26} \, m \approx 2^{206} \ell_{P}
$$

Therefore, the logarithmic middle is $2^{103} \, \ell_{P}$, so this will be our base unit.

I am using $2^8 = 4^3$ as my increment.
